After a long wait, how better to collect the new supercar than for the first time using my AMG G63 with a trailer to transport it to Topaz for PPF to be installed. There's going to be a lot of adventures to come with the Pro, I can't wait! Kicking off from the garage, the first stop is to take my AMG G63 over to Topaz, where the Skin was installed, but also to meet with Tony from Turbo Transport to hook up the trailer with which we're going to be collecting the new car. Having passed my test earlier in the summer for towing this type of setup, it's time to finally put it to use and how better than one AMG to collect another!?Logistically, a meet point at Topaz would make our day flow best, but also mean that Tony would be able to show me the ropes and help with the actual work to load and transport the new GT R Pro. We set off then to head towards Mercedes-Benz Brentford to take a first look at the new Shmeemobile.On display sits the GT R Pro, one of only 750 total cars being made, with mine in designo Diamond White paintwork with the satin grey decals to contrast the main colour, along with the titanium RXE wheels and the exposed visual carbon fibre. Powered by the 4.0l TT V8, the Pro shares a similar setup to the G63 with 585hp but features a 7spd dual clutch as opposed to the 9spd auto used by the G for extra torque and off-roading.Why not just drive it? Well as always with my cars, to prevent the risk of stone chips or damage, the car is immediately going to Topaz for the very best installation of Paint Protection Film to ensure it is always going to be in perfect shape. With horrible weather, and weird things happening on the roads around the time of year, not only does it protect the car but also gives an opportunity to use the G63 to tow. As such we unload back at Topaz before Tony is back on his way and it's time for the GT R Pro to head inside for detailing and the PPF install which we will see over the coming week or two.If you're interested to know more about finance, and/or receive a quote, take a look at Shmee150 Finance powered by Harrington: http://www.shmee150finance.comA special thanks to GT (my salesman at MB Brentford), to Topaz and of course to Turbo Tony for his time to show me the ropes for my first towing outing, give him a follow here:http://instagram.com/turbotransportThanks for watching, TimSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Shmee150YTWebsite: http://www.shmee150.comShop: http://shop.shmee150.comInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/shmee150Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/shmee150"

At the time of the disaster, it was the largest and most advanced ship ever constructed. Designed to carry more than 2,400 passengers and almost 900 crewmembers, the Titanic had certainly earned its name.But with over a century of advancement, how are today‚Äôs cruise ships different from those of Titanic‚Äôs day? Sure, we all know they‚Äôre now required to carry more lifeboats, but that isn‚Äôt exactly what makes them the life of the party.

The ship‚Äôs nine decks rose to an impressive 175 ft.- The SS Imperator would steal its crown a year later when it undertook his maiden voyage in 1913. - As of 2019, the largest cruise ship in the world is the Symphony of the Seas, which is operated by Royal Caribbean.- 1184 ft across and 215 ft wide, her eighteen decks are double the Titanic‚Äôs height and provide spacious accommodations for well over five thousand passengers. - Think of it as the difference between a city bus and a tour bus. You board a cruise ship to have fun and an ocean liner when you need to get somewhere.- First-class passengers would enjoy a saltwater pool, spa, gymnasium, and multiple restaurants decorated in the styles of French caf√©s and swanky New York hotels. - Second-class rooms were smaller and not as glamorous, but luxuriously furnished.- Third Class, also known as steerage, wasn't quite so luxurious, although the accommodations were still nicer than on many ships of the same era.- Modern cruise ships don‚Äôt really have classes in the way as the Titanic or even modern airlines. - Even the least expensive room on a cruise ship is still going to be about the level of a modest hotel room.- In addition to TVs and in-room slides, there are many other amenities found on modern cruise ships that wouldn‚Äôt have been available in the early twentieth century.- Shipbuilding had to come a long way before these immense mobile vacation spots became a reality.- The Titanic was constructed in Belfast harbor on a special slipway built specifically to accommodate its unprecedented bulk.- The hull of the Titanic was made up of thousands of these overlapping plates with the lower hull consisting of two layers. - Titanic's primary safety feature was the sixteen watertight compartments making up the lower decks. - Ships of today are still made from steel, but advancements in smelting and metallurgy have resulted in hulls stronger and less brittle than were possible a hundred years ago. - Speaking of the engines, modern cruise ships run primarily on either diesel, natural gas, or some combination of the two. - The most unusual aspect of modern cruise construction is that they're not built hull to funnel as a single construction. - The largest cruise ships and oil tankers are assembled in just six locations worldwide, the most prolific being the Hyundai Heavy Industries shipyard in South Korea.
