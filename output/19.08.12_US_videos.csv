The singing competition series is hosted by Nick Cannon and features panelists Jenny McCarthy, Nicole Scherzinger, Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke.The show features celebrities facing off against one another with one major twist: each singer is shrouded from head to toe in an elaborate costume, complete with full face mask to conceal his or her identity. Season Two boasts 16 celebrity singers in all-new costumes and masks, including The Flamingo, The Leopard and The Egg.With each performance, the host, panelists, audience, viewers and even the other contestants are left guessing who is singing behind the mask. Ranging from Grammy Award winners to legendary athletes, and everything in between, the singers may attempt to throw the crowd off of their scent, while keen observers might pick up on tiny clues buried throughout the show. One singer will be eliminated each week, ultimately revealing his or her true identity. It’s not a “whodunit,” it’s a “whosungit!”#TheMaskedSinger #TheReveal The Butterfly Is Revealed As Michelle Williams | Season 2 Ep. 9 | THE MASKED SINGERhttps://www.youtube.com/c/MaskedSingerFOX"

Step 5: Add in ¾ teaspoon of salt if they're large, ½ teaspoon if they're small, if you're unsure start with a bit and add more laterStep 6: Throw the cilantro in the trash if you have that genetic defect, otherwise, chop up a handful and throw it in the bowl with the avocado and squeeze a couple lime wedges in then chop up a deseeded tomato and add that in and around ⅓ to ½ cup finely chopped onion and then some jalapeño, don't be a baby, you love jalapeño but don't overdo it or you'll cry like a baby and it will also hurt on the way out.

And it involved a clown dancing on a roof.In this episode of Vox Almanac, Vox’s Phil Edwards explores the beginning of rotoscoping, a technique animators can use to create realistic motion. Invented by Max Fleischer of Fleischer Studios (and echoed and practiced by many others), it involves taking filmed footage and using it as a traceable model for animation. The results are fluid and natural in a way animation had never been before.As the above video shows, it started with Max’s brother Dave dancing on a roof in a clown costume. Footage of that was then used to model the classic Koko the Clown cartoons, which formed the basis for many Fleischer Studios films. Today, animators still use techniques like rotoscoping to turn real movement into animation.Check out the original patent!https://patents.google.com/patent/US1242674A/enIf you want to learn more about early animation, check out Fleischer Studios on the web and YouTube.https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtCAhYwGZxcAPDpu5Q7ueKQYou can also read Man and Superman: The Fleischer Studio Negotiates the Real in Quarterly Review of Film and Video by J.P.

Also thanks to Shane Dawson & Jeffree Star for making an amazing doc & giving me the idea. PS: I asked Trisha Paytas,  she said yes, seemed excited called her on shoot day & she actually ghosted me! TRUE STORY! lol Also PS: Originally i wanted to use the song Tati Westbrook used in her launch (GREAT SONG)  but the artist couldn't cus Tati got exclusive rights allegedly & this was all a joke thought she would give me permission but she just IGNORED ME! I would have been fine with a NO but ignoring me all together? You never going to catch me with some halo beauty unless you see on halo 3! Also PS: I love you guys i hope everyone gets a good laugh from this & remember to unlock your inner clown at all times on the internet!"

This is the cosmic microwave background radiation - the left-over heat-glow from the very early universe. We can’t see this microwave light with our eyes, but we can catch it with even a simple radio antenna. As soon as we became aware of its existence we’ve been feverishly building better and better devices to collect it. Why? Because it encodes so many secrets. And within this light, a group of scientists have just found evidence of the limits of space. A clue that our universe may be actually be finite in size. Today on Space Time Journal Club we’ll delve into the Nature Astronomy paper that just reported this: Planck evidence for a closed Universe and a possible crisis for cosmology by Eleonora Di Valentino, Alessandro Melchiorri, and Joe Silk.Special Thanks to Our PatreonsBig BangAlexander TamasAndrew & BrennaCraig StonahaDavid BarnholdtDavid NicklasFabrice EapJohn SJuan BenetMatt MillerMorgan HoughQuasarMark HeisingMark RosenthalVinnie FalcoHypernovaChuck ZegarDanton SpiveyDonal BotkinEdmund FokschanerHank SJohn HofmannJohn PollockJohn R.

It's gone by so quickly and even though I had an amazing year and did a tonne of things, there were still things that I just never got around to doing. That's how I came up with this fun concept of doing things that I never got to do as a kid. Everyone has a different childhood but these are just some of the activities that I hear my friends were able to do when they were young that I missed out on. Well its never too late to try them now!
