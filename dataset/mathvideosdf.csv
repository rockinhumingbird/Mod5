Dirichlet's paper:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.1408.pdf

Important error correction: In the video, I say that Dirichlet showed that the primes are equally distributed among allowable residue classes, but this is not historically accurate.  (By ""allowable"", here, I mean a residue class whose elements are coprime to the modulus, as described in the video).  What he actually showed is that the sum of the reciprocals of all primes in a given allowable residue class diverges, which proves that there are infinitely many primes in such a sequence.

Dirichlet observed this equal distribution numerically and noted this in his paper, but it wasn't until decades later that this fact was properly proved, as it required building on some of the work of Riemann in his famous 1859 paper.  If I'm not mistaken, I think it wasn't until Vallée Poussin in (1899), with a version of the prime number theorem for residue classes like this, but I could be wrong there.

In many ways, this was a very silly error for me to have let through.  It is true that this result was proven with heavy use of complex analysis, and in fact, it's in a complex analysis lecture that I remember first learning about it.  But of course, this would have to have happened after Dirichlet because it would have to have happened after Riemann!

My apologies for the mistake.  If you notice factual errors in videos that are not already mentioned in the video's description or pinned comment, don't hesitate to let me know.

Typo correction: At 14:45, the last index on the bias vector is n, when it's supposed to in fact be a k.  Thanks for the sharp eyes that caught that!

For those who want to learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen introducing neural networks and deep learning: https://goo.gl/Zmczdy

There are two neat things about this book.  First, it's available for free, so consider joining me in making a donation Nielsen's way if you get something out of it.  And second, it's centered around walking through some code and data which you can download yourself, and which covers the same example that I introduce in this video.  Yay for active learning!

NY Times blog post about this problem:

The original paper by Gregory Galperin:
https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~lebed/Galperin.%20Playing%20pool%20with%20pi.pdf

Evidently, Numberphile also described this problem (I had not known):
https://youtu.be/abv4Fz7oNr0
You'll notice that video has an added factor of 16 throughout, which is not here.  That's because they're only counting the collisions between blocks (well, balls in their case), and they're only counting to the point where the big block starts moving the other way.

Also, in a different video ""What does it feel like to invent math"", I give a completely different example of how adding up growing positive numbers can meaningfully give a negative number, so long as you loosen your understanding of what distance should mean for numbers: https://youtu.be/XFDM1ip5HdU

Interestingly, that vertical line where the convergent portion of the function appears to abruptly stop corresponds to numbers whose real part is Euler's constant, ~0.577.  For those who know what this is, it's kind of fun to puzzle about why this is the case.

Music by Vince Rubinetti: https://soundcloud.com/vincerubinetti/riemann-zeta-function

One technical note: It's possible to have fractals with an integer dimension.  The example to have in mind is some *very* rough curve, which just so happens to achieve roughness level exactly 2.  Slightly rough might be around 1.1-dimension; quite rough could be 1.5; but a very rough curve could get up to 2.0 (or more).  A classic example of this is the boundary of the Mandelbrot set.  The Sierpinski pyramid also has dimension 2 (try computing it!).

The proper definition of a fractal, at least as Mandelbrot wrote it, is a shape whose ""Hausdorff dimension"" is greater than its ""topological dimension"".  Hausdorff dimension is similar to the box-counting one I showed in this video, in some sense counting using balls instead of boxes, and it coincides with box-counting dimension in many cases. But it's more general, at the cost of being a bit harder to describe.  

Topological dimension is something that's always an integer, wherein (loosely speaking) curve-ish things are 1-dimensional, surface-ish things are two-dimensional, etc.  For example, a Koch Curve has topological dimension 1, and Hausdorff dimension 1.262.  A rough surface might have topological dimension 2, but fractal dimension  2.3.  And if a curve with topological dimension 1 has a Hausdorff dimension that *happens* to be exactly 2, or 3, or 4, etc., it would be considered a fractal, even though it's fractal dimension is an integer.

See Mandelbrot's book ""The Fractal Geometry of Nature"" for the full details and more examples.

Error correction: I meant to describe Kolmogorov as a “20th-century mathematician” not “19th-century”.  Whoops!  I think during the narration I must have made the classic 1900s vs. 19th-century mix up.  Anyone aware of his work is more than aware of what century he lived in, which apparently applies to quite a few commenters.

I'm not sure where the perspective shown in this video originates.  I do know you can find it in Tristan Needham's excellent book ""Visual Complex Analysis"", but if anyone has a sense of the first occurrence of this intuition do feel free to share.  It's simple and natural enough, though, that it's probably a view which has been independently thought up many times over.

Many of you shared solutions, attempts, and simulations with me this last week.  I loved it!  Y'all are the best.  Here are just two of my favorites.

And here's a lovely interactive built by GitHub user prajwalsouza after watching this video: https://prajwalsouza.github.io/Experiments/Colliding-Blocks.html

NY Times blog post about this problem:
https://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/pi/

The original paper by Gregory Galperin:
https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~lebed/Galperin.%20Playing%20pool%20with%20pi.pdf

For anyone curious about if the tan(x) ≈ x approximation, being off by only a cubic error term, is actually close enough not to affect the final count, take a look at sections 9 and 10 of Galperin's paper.  In short, it could break if there were some point where among the first 2N digits of pi, the last N of them were all 9's.  This seems exceedingly unlikely, but it quite hard to disprove.

Although I found the approach shown in this video independently, after the fact I found that Gary Antonick, who wrote the Numberplay blog referenced above, was the first to solve it this way.  In some ways, I think this is the most natural approach one might take given the problem statement, as corroborated by the fact that many solutions people sent my way in this last week had this flavor.  The Galperin solution you will see in the next video, though, involves a wonderfully creative perspective.

Even though we described how winding numbers can be used to solve 2d equations at a high level, it's worth pointing out that there are a few details missing for if you wanted to actually implement this.  For example, in order to determine how often to sample points, you'd want to have some bounds on the rate at which the direction of the output changes.  We will perhaps discuss this more in a follow-on video!

Cryptocurrency video: https://youtu.be/bBC-nXj3Ng4

Several people have commented about how 2^256 would be the maximum number of attempts, not the average.  This depends on the thing being attempted.  If it's guessing a private key, you are correct, but for something like guessing which input to a hash function gives the desired output (as in bitcoin mining, for example), which is the kind of thing I had in mind here, 2^256 would indeed be the average number of attempts needed, at least for a true cryptographic hash function.  Think of rolling a die until you get a 6, how many rolls do you need to make, on average?

In this episode, I ask him about his workflow, the tools he uses, the nature of consciousness, machine learning, & so much more!  Grant studied mathematics at Stanford as an undergraduate, then became a multivariable calculus fellow for KhanAcademy through their talent search program. He started making math animation videos on Youtube in 2015, and has since amassed over 2 million subscribers. It was a wonderful conversation, and I hope you enjoy it!

Check out Mathologer's video on the many cousins of the Pythagorean theorem:

On the topic of Mathologer, he also has a nice video about the Basel problem:

Some of you may be concerned about the final step here where we said the circle approaches a line.  What about all the lighthouses on the far end?  Well, a more careful calculation will show that the contributions from those lights become more negligible.  In fact, the contributions from almost all lights become negligible.  For the ambitious among you, see this paper for full details.

If you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then ""add subtitles/cc"".  I really appreciate those who do this, as it helps make the lessons accessible to more people.

Envy free cake cutting (the paper mentioned): https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03655

A clarifying note from Hannah: n^n^n^n^n^n is the maximum number of cuts in the n person case.

Something we could have made clearer... Bob's trimmed piece still carries the status of his ""first choice"", so if Charlie leaves it, Bob will (must) pick it... otherwise he'll pick the one that was his original ""second choice""... The upshot of this is that there's no chance Alice will be left with the trimmed piece after everyone takes their first piece. And Bob remains envy free under these conditions too.

Hey, why did you make this two videos and not just one?
Because two videos would have been very long and deterred casual viewers from even learning about the problem.
Makes more sense to make a video which describes the problem  and the solution, plus its history and the fact a one sentence proof exists... then have a more technical second video for people who want to see the proof itself. I have made links to the second video as clear as possible and I suspect more technical fans subscribe to Numberphile2 anyway.

Correction: At 4:08 the number at the bottom should be the prime 23, not 22..."

Hi there, in this video I am going to be talking about homoskedasticity as one of the Gauss-Markov assumptions. So, first of all, what do we mean by homoskedasticity? Well, in fact we mean homoskedasticity of our errors. Which means that the variance of our errors, given our independent variables 'x', is constant. So, if I was to think about there being some relationship between y and x, and I had some sort of sample of data, which looks something like this, and perhaps I then fit a straight line to this data so that I am using a linear model - linear in my independent variable 'x'. Then we can sort of think about the errors which our model is making are basically constant across our independent variable 'x'. They are basically the same as I increase my 'x' variable - all the errors lie within straight error bars. Well, we can contrast this with the situation where we have heteroskedastic errors. So here it would be the case if I had my y and x, and I had some points, some data points which as x increases there is a larger variance in y, if I then go ahead and fit a straight line to that data - so perhaps my straight line would do something like that. We can see that the errors which our model is making, are increasing in magnitude, as 'x' increases. So, if I fit an error line indicating the direction of increase of my errors, then you can see that my errors are increasing along my 'x' variable. So, this is what we call heteroskedasticity, so homo- in this context means that the errors are the same, so that's this sort of case, and hetero here means that the errors are different. Well, mathematically how do we write that? We write that the variance of our errors 'u' given our 'x', is some sort of function of x - it depends on 'x'. Here it is some sort of positive function because as my x increases, the magnitude of my errors increase as well. So, why do we care about our errors being homoskedastic? Well, as I said it is one of the Gauss-Markov assumptions, and if it is violated this means that our least-squared estimators are no longer BLUE. In particular, they are no longer best. So, there are other linear, unbiased estimators which have a lower sampling variance. Intuitively this means that there are other estimators which are linear and unbiased, which more often, or more frequently than least-squares will get closer to the true population parameters. And the intuition from this is essentially that - if I have heteroskedastic errors, there is some sort of information which is inherent in my system which I'm not including in my model. And perhaps if I include that information into my model, so I include the fact that I expect my errors to increase as 'x' increases, then perhaps I can come up with an estimator which actually gets closer to my y values more of the time. So that is the underlying intuition for why heteroskedasticity means that I can construct another estimator, which has a lower variance than least-squares. In the next few videos I'm going to give some actual examples of where heteroskedasticity arises, and that's going to conclude our discussion of the Gauss-Markov assumptions.

Ben believes in the transformative power of stories and art, and for a student work,
created a hybrid comic and learning resource drawing on his own experiences to address this problem.

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

LYRICS:

Oh Beautiful Star of Bethlehem
Shining afar through shadows dim
Giving the light for those who long have gone
Guiding the wise men on their way
Unto the place where Jesus lay
Oh Beautiful Star of Bethlehem shine on.

Oh Beautiful Star of Bethlehem      (Star of Bethlehem)
Shine upon us until the glory dawns.
Give us a light to guide the way
Unto the land of perfect day
Oh Beautiful Star of Bethlehem, shine on (shine on)

Oh Beautiful Star the hope of light
Guiding the pilgrims through the night
Over the mountains till the break of dawn
Into the light of perfect day
It will give out a lovely ray
Oh Beautiful Star of Bethlehem shine on (shine on)

Oh Beautiful Star the hope of rest
For the redeemed the good and blessed
Yonder in glory when the crown is won
Jesus is now the star divine
Brighter and brighter he will shine
Oh Beautiful Star of Bethlehem shine on (shine on)

It can be used to identify patterns in highly complex datasets and it can tell you what variables in your data are the most important. Lastly, it can tell you how accurate your new understanding of the data actually is.

In this video, I go one step at a time through PCA, and the method used to solve it, Singular Value Decomposition. I take it nice and slowly so that the simplicity of the method is revealed and clearly explained.

That video provides context that gives this video more meaning.

Here's one of those tricky little things, Probability vs. Likelihood. In common conversation we use these words interchangeably. However, statisticians make a clear distinction that is important to understand if you want to follow their logic. The good news is that they are both super simple. The bad news is that they are easy to get mixed up. The StatQuest gives you visual images that make them both easy to remember so you'll always keep them straight.

When you fit a machine learning method to a training dataset, you're probably using Gradient Descent. It can optimize parameters in a wide variety of settings. Since it's so fundamental to Machine Learning, I decided to make a ""step-by-step"" video that shows you exactly how it works.

There is a minor error at 18:53 and beyond - the two parts of the derivative, with respect to the slope, that I did not explicitly derive have an extra “square” at the end of them. Ignore this extra ""square"".

If you're looking for a complete SQL tutorial for beginners with examples, this tutorial is a great way to learn SQL basics. Just follow through and you'll be able to write SQL queries in no time. 

SQL, short for Structured Query Language, is a language used by software developers, data scientists and anyone who works with data. With SQL, you can store data in relational databases and write queries to extract valuable information. 

There are various database management systems (DBMS) that support SQL but each product has its own implementation of SQL. In this course, we'll be using MySQL to learn SQL. MySQL is the most popular free and open-source database management system in the world. If you use a different DBMS (eg SQL Server), you can still benefit from this course as 90% of the skills you'll learn in this course can be transferred to other database management systems.

JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in 2019. A lot of people are learning JavaScript to become front-end and/or back-end developers. 

I've designed this JavaScript tutorial for beginners to learn JavaScript from scratch. We'll start off by answering the frequently asked questions by beginners about JavaScript and shortly after we'll set up our development environment and start coding. 

Whether you're a beginner and want to learn to code, or you know any programming language and just want to learn JavaScript for web development, this tutorial helps you learn JavaScript fast. 

You don't need any prior experience with JavaScript or any other programming languages. Just watch this JavaScript tutorial to the end and you'll be writing JavaScript code in no time. 

If you want to become a front-end developer, you have to learn JavaScript. It is the programming language that every front-end developer must know. 

You can also use JavaScript on the back-end using Node. Node is a run-time environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser. With Node and Express (a popular JavaScript framework), you can build back-end of web and mobile applications. 

If you're looking for a crash course that helps you get started with JavaScript quickly, this course is for you.

In this video, I'm going to answer the top questions about Python: 

- What is Python?

- What kind of applications can you build with Python?
- How to learn Python?

Python is one of the top three most popular programming languages in 2019 and everybody is learning Python either to make their life easier or to expand their job opportunities. 

Python is often used in:
- Data science and machine learning
- Web development
- Automation 

In fact, if you want to get into data science and machine learning, Python is THE language that you must learn. 

Python and Django (a popular Python framework) are also very popular choices for building the backend of web applications. Small or big companies use Python to re-write their existing applications or build new applications. Instagram, DropBox, and YouTube are examples of websites built with Python. Well, more accurately, the backend of these applications is built with Python and Django. 

Python is also very popular for writing scripts to automate repetitive boring tasks that waste their time. 

If you want to expand your career opportunities, you should learn Python in 2019.
